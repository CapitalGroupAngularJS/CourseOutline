**Course Description:
AngularJS for Capital Group Intermediate Course**

**Course Number:** Custom
**Duration:** 3 Days

**AngularJS Training Overview**

Accelebrate’s Intermediate AngularJS training teaches developers how to
use AngularJS to facilitate development of web applications that use the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Best practices build on John
Papa’s Angular Style Guide and Clean Code Patterns as well as Test
Driven Development practices will be covered throughout the course.

**AngularJS Training Prerequisites**

All attendees must have substantial prior experience developing with
HTML and JavaScript as well as some basic understanding of AngularJS
development practices.  If attendees will not have prior JavaScript
experience, we would be delighted to proceed this class with a one or
two day intensive JavaScript primer.

**Hands-on/Lecture Ratio**

This AngularJS training class is 65% hands-on, 35% lecture, with the
longest lecture segments lasting for 20 minutes.

**AngularJS Training Materials**

All attendees receive courseware and the latest/best AngularJS.

**Software Needed on Each Student PC**

-   Google Chrome installed, other modern browsers as desired

-   IDE or code editor of your choice

-   Node.js installed
